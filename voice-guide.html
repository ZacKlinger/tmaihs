<h1>Voice Guide: TMAHS AI Fluency Micro-Courses</h1>

<h2>The Sound of This Voice</h2>
<p>Write like you're sitting across from a colleague who teaches down the hall. You respect them. You know their day is hard. You're not performing expertise — you're sharing something useful because you've been thinking about it and you think they'll find it interesting.</p>
<p>Every sentence earns its place. If it doesn't teach, surprise, or move — cut it.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Sentence-Level Craft: 5 Before/After Rewrites</h2>

<h3>1. Kill the throat-clearing.</h3>
<div class="before-after">
    <div class="before">
        <strong>Before:</strong>
        <em>"In this micro-course, you'll learn the Constraints mental model — the foundation of getting useful, classroom-ready outputs from any AI tool."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="after">
        <strong>After:</strong>
        <em>"There's a reason AI keeps giving you generic worksheets. You're not giving it enough to work with."</em>
    </div>
</div>

<h3>2. Replace abstractions with the thing itself.</h3>
<div class="before-after">
    <div class="before">
        <strong>Before:</strong>
        <em>"Vague requests produce generic outputs. Specific constraints produce materials you can actually use."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="after">
        <strong>After:</strong>
        <em>"'Create activities for my project' gets you clip art. 'Create a Week 5 nutrient-tracking lab for students who just finished their pH baseline readings' gets you something you'd actually hand out."</em>
    </div>
</div>

<h3>3. Let the reader be the subject.</h3>
<div class="before-after">
    <div class="before">
        <strong>Before:</strong>
        <em>"This approach draws on Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller) — by constraining the task, you reduce extraneous cognitive load for both you and the AI."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="after">
        <strong>After:</strong>
        <em>"Sweller's cognitive load research explains why this works: the more you narrow the task, the less noise the AI has to sort through — and the less you have to sort through in its output."</em>
    </div>
</div>

<h3>4. Trade instruction for recognition.</h3>
<div class="before-after">
    <div class="before">
        <strong>Before:</strong>
        <em>"Think about a project you're currently planning or running. What phase are students in right now?"</em>
    </div>
    <div class="after">
        <strong>After:</strong>
        <em>"You already know where your students are in the project arc. The AI doesn't. That's the gap."</em>
    </div>
</div>

<h3>5. Make the insight land in one line.</h3>
<div class="before-after">
    <div class="before">
        <strong>Before:</strong>
        <em>"Key insight: In Gold Standard PBL, every activity connects to a driving question and public product. Your constraints should make those connections explicit."</em>
    </div>
    <div class="after">
        <strong>After:</strong>
        <em>"If your students are building toward something real, your prompts should know about it."</em>
    </div>
</div>

<h2>Rhythm Rules</h2>
<p><strong>Short sentences do the heavy lifting.</strong> They land a point. They shift attention. They create emphasis through contrast with the longer, more explanatory sentences around them.</p>
<p><strong>Let a paragraph breathe when the idea is important.</strong> After you've set something up, sometimes a single line does more than three.</p>
<p>That's where the learning happens.</p>
<p><strong>Use a one-line paragraph</strong> when you want the reader to pause. Not for drama — for absorption. The reader needs a beat to connect what they just read to their own experience.</p>
<p><strong>The pattern:</strong> Long enough to explain. Short enough to stick. Then silence.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Metaphor Palette</h2>
<p>Draw from things teachers do with their hands:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Gardening:</strong> pruning, tending, the difference between scattering seeds and planting them where they'll grow</li>
    <li><strong>Cooking:</strong> a recipe is only useful if it knows your kitchen; seasoning to taste; mise en place</li>
    <li><strong>Music:</strong> tuning, the rest between notes, playing in the right key for the room</li>
    <li><strong>Craft / building:</strong> measuring twice, the difference between a sketch and a blueprint, sanding rough edges</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Never:</strong> leverage, unlock, empower, transform, journey, deep dive, game-changer, robust, seamless, cutting-edge</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Question Trick</h2>
<p>This voice asks questions the reader was already thinking but hadn't quite articulated. Not rhetorical flourishes — genuine cognitive mirrors.</p>
<p>The test: Could the reader answer the question from their own experience? If yes, it's a good question. If it's just a setup for your next point, cut it.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Yes: <em>"Have you noticed that AI gives you better rubrics when you're more specific about the audience?"</em></li>
    <li>Yes: <em>"What did your students actually produce last week that this activity should build on?"</em></li>
    <li>No: <em>"But what makes a truly effective constraint?"</em> (This is a lecture in disguise.)</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>What to NEVER Do: 10 Tells of AI-Generated Writing</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>"In this micro-course, you'll learn..."</strong> — Don't narrate the learning. Just teach.</li>
    <li><strong>"Let's dive in" / "Let's explore"</strong> — No one is diving anywhere.</li>
    <li><strong>Starting 3+ consecutive paragraphs with "This"</strong> — Vary your sentence openings.</li>
    <li><strong>Colon-list-of-three pattern</strong> — <em>"three key principles: clarity, specificity, and alignment."</em> Real writers don't inventory their points like a warehouse.</li>
    <li><strong>"Whether you're a new teacher or a veteran..."</strong> — Don't hedge for every audience. Pick one and write to them.</li>
    <li><strong>"It's important to note that..."</strong> — If it's important, just say it.</li>
    <li><strong>"By [doing X], you can [achieve Y]"</strong> — This construction is a tell. Rewrite it every time.</li>
    <li><strong>Exclamation points for false energy</strong> — Enthusiasm comes from content, not punctuation.</li>
    <li><strong>Transitional phrases as crutches</strong> — "Furthermore," "Additionally," "Moreover" — if your paragraphs need these to connect, they're in the wrong order.</li>
    <li><strong>The wrap-up paragraph that restates everything</strong> — End with a door, not a summary. Give them something to do or think about — don't recap what they just read.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2>The CFU Voice</h2>
<p>A CFU question should sound like a sharp colleague leaning over and saying, <em>"Okay, but which one would you actually use?"</em></p>
<p>Not precious. Not gamified. Not "Great job, now let's test your knowledge!" Just direct.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Frame it as a real decision: <em>"You're prepping for tomorrow. Which of these prompts gets you something usable?"</em></li>
    <li>Explanations after answering should teach, not scold: <em>"The first one sounds reasonable, but notice it doesn't tell the AI what students already know. That's why the output would start from scratch."</em></li>
    <li>Incorrect-answer feedback should be generous: acknowledge why the wrong answer was tempting, then show what's missing.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>How Citations Work</h2>
<p>Citations should feel like a colleague recommending a book — casual, specific, confident. The reader should feel like they're being let in on something good, not being lectured at.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Yes: <em>"Sweller's cognitive load work explains why this matters — the more you narrow the task, the less noise both you and the AI have to wade through."</em></li>
    <li>Yes: <em>"PBLWorks calls this 'Gold Standard' design — every activity connects back to a driving question and a public product."</em></li>
    <li>No: <em>"This approach draws on Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller, 1988)."</em></li>
    <li>No: <em>"Research has shown that project-based learning (Krajcik & Blumenfeld, 2006) is effective."</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The research is there because it's useful, not because it proves you did your homework.</p>
