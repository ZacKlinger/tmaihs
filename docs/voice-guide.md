# Voice Guide: TMAHS AI Fluency Micro-Courses

## The Sound of This Voice

Write like you're sitting across from a colleague who teaches down the hall. You respect them. You know their day is hard. You're not performing expertise — you're sharing something useful because you've been thinking about it and you think they'll find it interesting.

The writing should feel smooth. Not flat — smooth. The kind of writing where one idea leads naturally into the next, where the reader doesn't notice the craft because they're too busy following the thought. Every sentence earns its place, but it earns it by carrying the reader forward, not by stopping them in their tracks.

## Sentence-Level Craft: 5 Before/After Rewrites

**1. Skip the throat-clearing.**
- Before: *"In this micro-course, you'll learn the Constraints mental model — the foundation of getting useful, classroom-ready outputs from any AI tool."*
- After: *"When AI gives you something generic, it's usually because the prompt didn't have enough to work with. That's where constraints come in."*

**2. Replace abstractions with the thing itself.**
- Before: *"Vague requests produce generic outputs. Specific constraints produce materials you can actually use."*
- After: *"'Create activities for my project' gets you clip art. 'Create a Week 5 nutrient-tracking lab for students who just finished their pH baseline readings' gets you something you'd actually hand out."*

**3. Let the reader be the subject.**
- Before: *"This approach draws on Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller) — by constraining the task, you reduce extraneous cognitive load for both you and the AI."*
- After: *"Sweller's cognitive load research explains why this works: the more you narrow the task, the less noise the AI has to sort through — and the less you have to sort through in its output."*

**4. Trade instruction for recognition.**
- Before: *"Think about a project you're currently planning or running. What phase are students in right now?"*
- After: *"You already know where your students are in the project arc — the AI doesn't, and that's the kind of detail that makes the difference."*

**5. Let the insight arrive naturally.**
- Before: *"Key insight: In Gold Standard PBL, every activity connects to a driving question and public product. Your constraints should make those connections explicit."*
- After: *"If your students are building toward something real — a driving question, a public product — your prompts should reflect that. The AI can't connect the dots you haven't drawn."*

## Rhythm Rules

**Vary the length, but keep it moving.** Short sentences still matter — they clarify, they reset, they give the reader a foothold. But they work best when they're woven into longer, more natural stretches of thought. The goal isn't punch. It's flow.

**Let a paragraph breathe when the idea is important.** After you've set something up, a single line can do more than three — not because it's dramatic, but because it gives the reader space to connect what they just read to something they already know.

**Smooth writing doesn't call attention to its structure.** If the reader notices you used a short sentence for effect, you overdid it. The best rhythm feels like someone thinking out loud — unhurried, clear, and easy to follow.

**The pattern:** Long enough to explain. Short enough to clarify. Then keep going.

## Metaphor Palette

Draw from things teachers do with their hands:

- **Gardening:** pruning, tending, the difference between scattering seeds and planting them where they'll grow
- **Cooking:** a recipe is only useful if it knows your kitchen; seasoning to taste; mise en place
- **Music:** tuning, the rest between notes, playing in the right key for the room
- **Craft / building:** measuring twice, the difference between a sketch and a blueprint, sanding rough edges

**Never:** leverage, unlock, empower, transform, journey, deep dive, game-changer, robust, seamless, cutting-edge

## The Question Trick

This voice asks questions the reader was already thinking but hadn't quite articulated. Not rhetorical flourishes — genuine cognitive mirrors.

The test: Could the reader answer the question from their own experience? If yes, it's a good question. If it's just a setup for your next point, cut it.

- Yes: *"Have you noticed that AI gives you better rubrics when you're more specific about the audience?"*
- Yes: *"What did your students actually produce last week that this activity should build on?"*
- No: *"But what makes a truly effective constraint?"* (This is a lecture in disguise.)

## What to NEVER Do: 10 Tells of AI-Generated Writing

1. **"In this micro-course, you'll learn..."** — Don't narrate the learning. Just teach.
2. **"Let's dive in" / "Let's explore"** — Skip the false momentum.
3. **Starting 3+ consecutive paragraphs with "This"** — Vary your sentence openings.
4. **Colon-list-of-three pattern** — *"three key principles: clarity, specificity, and alignment."* Real writers don't inventory their points like a warehouse.
5. **"Whether you're a new teacher or a veteran..."** — Don't hedge for every audience. Pick one and write to them.
6. **"It's important to note that..."** — If it's important, just say it.
7. **"By [doing X], you can [achieve Y]"** — This construction is a tell. Rewrite it every time.
8. **Exclamation points for false energy** — Enthusiasm comes from content, not punctuation.
9. **Transitional phrases as crutches** — "Furthermore," "Additionally," "Moreover" — if your paragraphs need these to connect, they're in the wrong order.
10. **The wrap-up paragraph that restates everything** — End by giving them something to do or think about. Don't recap what they just read.

## The CFU Voice

A CFU question should sound like a colleague turning to you and saying, *"Okay, but which one would you actually use?"*

Not precious. Not gamified. Not "Great job, now let's test your knowledge!" Just natural and direct.

- Frame it as a real decision: *"You're prepping for tomorrow. Which of these prompts gets you something usable?"*
- Explanations after answering should teach, not scold: *"The first one sounds reasonable, but notice it doesn't tell the AI what students already know. That's why the output would start from scratch."*
- Incorrect-answer feedback should be generous: acknowledge why the wrong answer was tempting, then show what's missing.

## How Citations Work

Citations should feel like a colleague recommending a book — casual, specific, confident. The reader should feel like they're being let in on something good, not being lectured at.

- Yes: *"Sweller's cognitive load work explains why this matters — the more you narrow the task, the less noise both you and the AI have to wade through."*
- Yes: *"PBLWorks calls this 'Gold Standard' design — every activity connects back to a driving question and a public product."*
- No: *"This approach draws on Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller, 1988)."*
- No: *"Research has shown that project-based learning (Krajcik & Blumenfeld, 2006) is effective."*

The research is there because it's useful, not because it proves you did your homework.
