# Voice Guide: TMAHS AI Fluency Micro-Courses

## The Sound of This Voice

Write like you're sitting across from a colleague who teaches down the hall. You respect them. You know their day is hard. You're not performing expertise — you're sharing something useful because you've been thinking about it and you think they'll find it interesting.

Every sentence earns its place. If it doesn't teach, surprise, or move — cut it.

## Sentence-Level Craft: 5 Before/After Rewrites

**1. Kill the throat-clearing.**
- Before: *"In this micro-course, you'll learn the Constraints mental model — the foundation of getting useful, classroom-ready outputs from any AI tool."*
- After: *"There's a reason AI keeps giving you generic worksheets. You're not giving it enough to work with."*

**2. Replace abstractions with the thing itself.**
- Before: *"Vague requests produce generic outputs. Specific constraints produce materials you can actually use."*
- After: *"'Create activities for my project' gets you clip art. 'Create a Week 5 nutrient-tracking lab for students who just finished their pH baseline readings' gets you something you'd actually hand out."*

**3. Let the reader be the subject.**
- Before: *"This approach draws on Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller) — by constraining the task, you reduce extraneous cognitive load for both you and the AI."*
- After: *"Sweller's cognitive load research explains why this works: the more you narrow the task, the less noise the AI has to sort through — and the less you have to sort through in its output."*

**4. Trade instruction for recognition.**
- Before: *"Think about a project you're currently planning or running. What phase are students in right now?"*
- After: *"You already know where your students are in the project arc. The AI doesn't. That's the gap."*

**5. Make the insight land in one line.**
- Before: *"Key insight: In Gold Standard PBL, every activity connects to a driving question and public product. Your constraints should make those connections explicit."*
- After: *"If your students are building toward something real, your prompts should know about it."*

## Rhythm Rules

**Short sentences do the heavy lifting.** They land a point. They shift attention. They create emphasis through contrast with the longer, more explanatory sentences around them.

**Let a paragraph breathe when the idea is important.** After you've set something up, sometimes a single line does more than three.

That's where the learning happens.

**Use a one-line paragraph** when you want the reader to pause. Not for drama — for absorption. The reader needs a beat to connect what they just read to their own experience.

**The pattern:** Long enough to explain. Short enough to stick. Then silence.

## Metaphor Palette

Draw from things teachers do with their hands:

- **Gardening:** pruning, tending, the difference between scattering seeds and planting them where they'll grow
- **Cooking:** a recipe is only useful if it knows your kitchen; seasoning to taste; mise en place
- **Music:** tuning, the rest between notes, playing in the right key for the room
- **Craft / building:** measuring twice, the difference between a sketch and a blueprint, sanding rough edges

**Never:** leverage, unlock, empower, transform, journey, deep dive, game-changer, robust, seamless, cutting-edge

## The Question Trick

This voice asks questions the reader was already thinking but hadn't quite articulated. Not rhetorical flourishes — genuine cognitive mirrors.

The test: Could the reader answer the question from their own experience? If yes, it's a good question. If it's just a setup for your next point, cut it.

- Yes: *"Have you noticed that AI gives you better rubrics when you're more specific about the audience?"*
- Yes: *"What did your students actually produce last week that this activity should build on?"*
- No: *"But what makes a truly effective constraint?"* (This is a lecture in disguise.)

## What to NEVER Do: 10 Tells of AI-Generated Writing

1. **"In this micro-course, you'll learn..."** — Don't narrate the learning. Just teach.
2. **"Let's dive in" / "Let's explore"** — No one is diving anywhere.
3. **Starting 3+ consecutive paragraphs with "This"** — Vary your sentence openings.
4. **Colon-list-of-three pattern** — *"three key principles: clarity, specificity, and alignment."* Real writers don't inventory their points like a warehouse.
5. **"Whether you're a new teacher or a veteran..."** — Don't hedge for every audience. Pick one and write to them.
6. **"It's important to note that..."** — If it's important, just say it.
7. **"By [doing X], you can [achieve Y]"** — This construction is a tell. Rewrite it every time.
8. **Exclamation points for false energy** — Enthusiasm comes from content, not punctuation.
9. **Transitional phrases as crutches** — "Furthermore," "Additionally," "Moreover" — if your paragraphs need these to connect, they're in the wrong order.
10. **The wrap-up paragraph that restates everything** — End with a door, not a summary. Give them something to do or think about — don't recap what they just read.

## The CFU Voice

A CFU question should sound like a sharp colleague leaning over and saying, *"Okay, but which one would you actually use?"*

Not precious. Not gamified. Not "Great job, now let's test your knowledge!" Just direct.

- Frame it as a real decision: *"You're prepping for tomorrow. Which of these prompts gets you something usable?"*
- Explanations after answering should teach, not scold: *"The first one sounds reasonable, but notice it doesn't tell the AI what students already know. That's why the output would start from scratch."*
- Incorrect-answer feedback should be generous: acknowledge why the wrong answer was tempting, then show what's missing.

## How Citations Work

Citations should feel like a colleague recommending a book — casual, specific, confident. The reader should feel like they're being let in on something good, not being lectured at.

- Yes: *"Sweller's cognitive load work explains why this matters — the more you narrow the task, the less noise both you and the AI have to wade through."*
- Yes: *"PBLWorks calls this 'Gold Standard' design — every activity connects back to a driving question and a public product."*
- No: *"This approach draws on Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller, 1988)."*
- No: *"Research has shown that project-based learning (Krajcik & Blumenfeld, 2006) is effective."*

The research is there because it's useful, not because it proves you did your homework.
