# Certification Pivot: Deliverable-First Redesign

## 1. COURSE MAPPING

The existing 10 courses stay. Their content is strong. What changes is how each course connects to its tier's deliverable.

### TIER 1 — THE AI CLASSROOM CONSTITUTION

**Courses:** Constraints, Role Assignment, Iteration (unchanged)

Each course contributes a section of the Constitution — the living document that becomes the teacher's system prompt.

| Course | What It Already Does Well | Constitution Section It Builds | What Needs to Change |
|--------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Constraints** | Teaches five constraints (project phase, prior work, time box, differentiation, final product). Workshop prompts already ask teachers to fill these in for their own classroom. | **Classroom Context** (students, grade, differentiation needs) and **Project Architecture** (current project, timeline, milestones, driving question, final product) | Reframe the workshop as "Draft sections 1–2 of your Constitution." The templates are already there — just name what teachers are building. The reflection should ask them to paste their Constitution sections into an AI tool and test whether the output improves. |
| **Role Assignment** | Teaches stakeholder perspective identification. Workshop asks teachers to identify real stakeholders for their projects. | **Stakeholder & Perspective Map** (who students interact with, community context, audience for final products, key perspectives to center) | Reframe workshop as "Draft section 3 of your Constitution." The stakeholder critique simulator prompt already asks for this — make the output format match the Constitution structure. Add: "Save this as part of your Constitution." |
| **Iteration** | Teaches critique and refinement cycles. Workshop asks what "good" looks like and how to refine outputs toward classroom-ready. | **Quality Standards** (what "classroom-ready" means in your room, revision expectations, how you evaluate, what your standards are) | The current workshop focuses on iterating a single prompt. Reframe it: the iteration target is the Constitution itself. Teachers draft a section, test it with AI, see the output, then refine the section. This makes iteration concrete AND produces the Constitution. |

**End of Tier 1 deliverable:** A complete AI Classroom Constitution the teacher can paste into any AI tool. It should have four sections (Context, Architecture, Stakeholders, Quality Standards) and immediately produce better outputs than prompting without it.

### TIER 2 — A PBL UNIT

**Courses:** Meta-Prompting, Persona Calling, Workflow Design (unchanged)

Each course contributes a phase of the PBL unit design process. The Constitution is the foundation — teachers load it first, then design on top of it.

| Course | What It Already Does Well | PBL Unit Phase It Builds | What Needs to Change |
|--------|--------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| **Meta-Prompting** | Teaches stress-testing prompts and designs before building materials. Workshop includes a "Project Pre-Mortem" template. | **Unit Critique & Gap Analysis** — stress-test the unit concept before investing time in building it out. Surfaces skill gaps, pacing risks, engagement drops, scaffolding holes. | Reframe: "Load your Constitution first. Then paste your unit idea. The meta-prompt should critique the idea against what you've already defined about your classroom." This is the quality gate before building. |
| **Persona Calling** | Teaches strategic perspective selection. Workshop includes multi-perspective project review. | **Multi-Perspective Design Review** — get feedback on the unit from a PBL specialist, a relevant community stakeholder, and a struggling student. | Reframe the workshop deliverable: "Get three perspectives on your unit plan. Note what changes. These perspectives become part of your design rationale." The persona library concept in the reflection already hints at this. |
| **Workflow Design** | Teaches chaining prompts using backward design. Workshop IS a complete PBL unit workflow: public product → driving question → assessment → milestones → scaffolds. | **The actual PBL unit** — this is where the deliverable gets built. The backward design workflow produces every component. | This course is already almost perfectly aligned. The workshop template literally builds a PBL unit step by step. What it needs: "Each step should reference your Constitution. Step 1 output feeds Step 2 input. Save the completed workflow as your PBL unit." |

**End of Tier 2 deliverable:** A complete PBL unit: driving question, project arc, milestone checkpoints, assessment rubric, and at least one AI-generated scaffold the teacher has refined and would actually use. Built on top of the Constitution.

### TIER 3 — A CLASSROOM AI POLICY

**Courses:** Critical Evaluation, Detecting AI Work, Student AI Activities, Curriculum AI Design (unchanged)

Each course contributes a section of the Classroom AI Policy — a practical framework the teacher could share with students, parents, and administrators.

| Course | What It Already Does Well | Policy Section It Builds | What Needs to Change |
|--------|--------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **Critical Evaluation** | Teaches the three-lens model (accuracy, bias, appropriateness). Workshop includes a generate-and-evaluate protocol. | **Evaluation Standards** — how AI outputs are vetted before use in the classroom. The teacher's personal three-lens checklist. | Reframe: "Write the evaluation section of your policy. What do you check before AI-generated materials reach your students?" The workshop's "3-question checklist" reflection already asks for this. Make it a formal section. |
| **Detecting AI Work** | Teaches designing for authenticity over detection. Workshop includes an authenticity audit. | **Authenticity by Design** — how assignments are structured so genuine work is the easier path. Not a detection protocol, but a design philosophy. | Reframe: "Write the section of your policy that explains how you design assignments. This is what you'd share with a parent who asks 'How do you handle AI cheating?'" The answer is design, not surveillance. |
| **Student AI Activities** | Teaches the PACE framework. Workshop includes student-facing activity templates (Devil's Advocate, Audience Simulator). | **Student AI Use Guidelines** — when and how students can use AI, with specific protocols. This is the section students actually read. | Reframe the workshop deliverable: "Draft the student-facing section of your policy. Include at least one PACE-structured activity students can reference as a model for productive AI use." |
| **Curriculum AI Design** | Teaches the AI Choreography framework (Present/Background/Absent). Workshop maps integration across a project arc. | **Integration Map** — where AI is present, background, and absent in the curriculum, with rationale for each decision. This is what an administrator reads. | Reframe: "Map your PBL unit (from Tier 2) using the choreography framework. This becomes the integration section of your policy — a clear picture of where AI fits and where it doesn't." |

**End of Tier 3 deliverable:** A Classroom AI Policy with four sections: Evaluation Standards, Authenticity by Design, Student AI Use Guidelines, and Integration Map. Something the teacher could hand to a student, a parent, or a principal and feel confident about.

## 2. THE CONSTITUTION'S SECTIONS

Built directly from Tier 1 workshop activities. Each section maps to a course.

### Section 1: Classroom Context (from Constraints)
The teacher writes:
- **Grade level and course name** — "10th grade SDC Science"
- **Student population** — class size, reading levels, EL students, IEP considerations
- **Differentiation needs** — what scaffolds are standard, what modifications are typical
- **Time constraints** — period length, how often you meet, interruptions to expect
- **District/school requirements** — standards alignment, required assessments, curriculum mandates

*Built during:* Constraints workshop. The "Mid-Project Checkpoint" template already asks for grade, course, differentiation, and time box. Make these outputs persistent.

### Section 2: Project Architecture (from Constraints)
The teacher writes:
- **Current project topic and driving question**
- **Timeline** — total weeks, current week
- **Milestones completed** — what students have already done
- **What's coming next** — the immediate next phase
- **Final product and audience** — what students are building and who sees it

*Built during:* Constraints workshop. Both starter prompts ask for this exact information. The teacher just needs to know they're building a document, not just completing an exercise.

### Section 3: Stakeholder & Perspective Map (from Role Assignment)
The teacher writes:
- **Key stakeholders** — who students will interact with (community members, presenters, audiences)
- **Stakeholder concerns and priorities** — what each cares about, what questions they'd ask
- **Community context** — neighborhood, relationships, sensitivities
- **Perspectives to center** — whose voices matter most for this project

*Built during:* Role Assignment workshop. The "Stakeholder Critique Simulator" prompt already maps stakeholder type, main concern, potential objection, and communication style. These become the Constitution's stakeholder section.

### Section 4: Quality Standards (from Iteration)
The teacher writes:
- **What "classroom-ready" means** — your bar for materials you'd actually use
- **Revision expectations** — how many drafts, what kind of feedback cycles
- **Assessment approach** — rubric style, point scale, what gets assessed
- **What "good" looks like** — examples or descriptions of strong work in your classroom

*Built during:* Iteration workshop. The iteration tips and reflection already ask teachers to set a "good enough" threshold and track iterations to classroom-ready. Formalize this as a Constitution section.

### What the finished Constitution looks like as a system prompt:

```
You are assisting a teacher with the following classroom context. Use this
information to make every output specific, relevant, and classroom-ready.

CLASSROOM: 10th grade SDC Science at Lincoln High. 28 students, mixed
reading levels (6th-10th grade). 8 EL students (emerging/developing).
Students work in groups of 3-4. Visual scaffolds and vocabulary support
are standard.

CURRENT PROJECT: Hydroponics and community food access.
Driving question: How can we grow food that feeds our neighborhood?
Timeline: 14 weeks, currently Week 5.
Completed: pH baseline readings, system construction, plant selection.
Next: Nutrient delivery system design.
Final product: Community presentation with live plant data + harvest
donation to the Third Street community fridge.

STAKEHOLDERS: Community fridge coordinator (cares about reliability and
volume). School board (annual showcase audience, cares about student
learning evidence). Parent volunteers (help in garden, want to see
student ownership).

QUALITY STANDARDS: Activities take 30-50 min and build on prior work.
Materials must reference specific student data and project milestones.
4-point rubric scale. Scaffolds for EL students in every assignment.
Everything connects to the driving question.
```

A teacher who loads this into any AI tool will get dramatically better outputs without rethinking their prompt each time. That's the whole point.

## 3. HOW THE CONSTITUTION GROWS

The Constitution doesn't stop at Tier 1. Each subsequent tier adds to it.

### Tier 2 Additions

After completing Tier 2, the teacher adds:

- **Design Principles** (from Meta-Prompting) — "When I stress-test a unit design, I check for: skill gap assumptions, pacing risks, engagement drops, scaffolding holes, assessment blind spots." This becomes a checklist they reuse.
- **Perspective Library** (from Persona Calling) — saved personas for their common project types. "For community projects, I always get feedback from: a PBL specialist, a relevant community member, and a struggling student."
- **Workflow Templates** (from Workflow Design) — reusable prompt chains for unit design. "My backward design workflow: product → driving question → rubric → milestones → scaffolds."

These are practical tools that sit alongside the classroom context. When the teacher starts a new project, they update the project-specific sections (Section 2) and run their saved workflows.

### Tier 3 Additions

After completing Tier 3, the teacher adds:

- **Evaluation Checklist** (from Critical Evaluation) — their personal three-lens protocol. "Before AI-generated materials reach students, I verify: (1) factual claims, (2) representation and framing, (3) fit for my students and community."
- **Authenticity Structures** (from Detecting AI Work) — assignment design principles. "My checkpoints require process evidence, oral components, and specificity that can only come from doing the work."
- **Student AI Protocols** (from Student AI Activities) — PACE-based guidelines for student use. "Students draft first, use AI as responder, evaluate AI critically, and document their thinking."
- **Integration Map** (from Curriculum AI Design) — the Present/Background/Absent choreography for their project. "AI is present at revision points, background for my planning, and absent during early skill-building and authentic assessment."

By the end of Tier 3, the Constitution is a comprehensive document: classroom context + design tools + evaluation standards + student guidelines. It's not just a system prompt anymore — it's a professional practice framework.

  ],
};
```

## 5. GAPS

### Gap 1: Teaching Identity (Tier 1)

**The problem:** The Constitution needs a section about the teacher's pedagogical commitments — their framework (PBL, UDL, culturally sustaining pedagogy), their philosophy, what they believe about how students learn. All three Tier 1 courses reference these frameworks but none asks the teacher to articulate their own commitments.

**The course:** "Teaching Identity" — a micro-course where teachers write the preamble of their Constitution: what kind of classroom they run, what instructional frameworks guide them, and what they believe about student learning. The mental model is that AI can't align to your philosophy if it doesn't know what your philosophy is.

**Severity:** Medium. The Constitution works without it, but it's the difference between a system prompt that describes logistics and one that captures the teacher's professional identity. Could also be addressed by adding a "preamble" exercise to the Constraints workshop rather than building a whole new course.

### Gap 2: Communicating the Policy (Tier 3)

**The problem:** The four Tier 3 courses build the teacher's judgment and the policy's content, but no course addresses how to frame and communicate the policy to different audiences. A parent reads differently than a student reads differently than an administrator.

**The course:** "Policy Communication" — a micro-course on framing AI policy for different audiences. The mental model is that the same policy needs different entry points depending on who's reading: students need clarity and examples, parents need reassurance and rationale, administrators need alignment to standards and risk management.

**Severity:** Low. This could be addressed in the Curriculum AI Design reflection rather than a standalone course. But if the deliverable is truly something the teacher "could hand to students and parents," some attention to audience framing would strengthen it.

---

## Summary

The 10 existing courses stay. Their content is solid. What changes:

1. **Tier names and descriptions** shift from skill-based ("Foundations," "Integrated Application," "Studio Practice") to deliverable-based ("The Constitution," "The Unit," "The Policy").

2. **Workshop activities** get reframed so teachers know they're building a section of a real document, not just completing an exercise. The actual workshop templates barely need to change — they already ask for the right information.

3. **Reflections** get updated to reference the deliverable: "Add this to your Constitution," "This becomes a section of your policy."

4. **Competency statements** shift from skill descriptions to deliverable descriptions.

5. **One probable gap** (Teaching Identity) that could be addressed either as a new course or as an addition to the Constraints workshop.

The architecture (`studioTiers.ts`, `moduleDefinitions.ts`, unlock logic) doesn't need structural changes. Same 10 courses, same 3 tiers, same unlock flow. The pivot is in framing, not plumbing.
